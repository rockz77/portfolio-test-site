# Guthy Renker Code Assessment
All simple single page website built using only pure ES5 Javascript/Jquery, HTML5, and CSS3. No use of a CSS preprocessor, asset manager (webpack, gulp), frontend framework (react, angular), or NodeJS for this project.

Simply open the file `index.html` to view. 

## NOTES:

- Only did the first image card to contain the scrolling/image parallax effect for demo purposes.
- Did not have enough time to complete all the rest of the dynamic functionality and components. This includes: the menu, remaining image cards with parallax effects, image carousel, specific hover effects, the bottom text/info on mobile, and the lower right spinner circle with load percentage.
- Also didn't get a chance to fully test on mobile and tablets.
- Used Photoshop to get specific graphics/icons from the received video.
- Created a "development" branch for testing purposes and did a test commit and merge for demo purposes.
